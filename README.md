# Thad Craft - Husband, Father, Software Engineer, Tech Leader

Hi, I’m Thad. I’m currently a Principal Software Engineer at [Kohl's](https://kohls.com/) leading payments, finance, and transactions. This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before.

It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team. Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a merge request.

## About Me

I was born and raised in northern Indiana. I spent nearly 10 years in Illinois for a job, but thanks to remote work, moved back to Indiana in 2019. My wife and I met in high school, attended Purdue University(Boiler Up!), and I skipped college graduation to marry her. We homeschool our 3 kids, raise a few pigs each year, and try to teach our kids through travel.

* I love sports, sometimes to the detriment of those around me.
* I am passionate about traveling and finding local cuisine.
* I try my best to be actively helpful and kind.
  * I'm working on saying "no" for my own metal wellbeing.
* I want to get into the details and learn the "how" of everything.
  * I am actively working on focusing on whether the work gets done and not how it gets done.
* I am very social and enjoy talking with people.
  * However, I am working to improve my focus to avoid distractions. Call me out if I get distracted.
* I have started to struggle with imposter syndrome as my career has progressed.
  * To help with this, I am attempting to reframe my definition of success. As an engineer it was easy to see success in working software, as a leader success comes from the outcomes of others.

### My Brand

First and foremost I am a husband and a father of 3 kids. On any given day I am a referee, chauffeur, hair stylist, and/or frozen pizza chef. Taking care of my family is what drives me. Combining both my personal and professional experience leads to my growth as an individual and shapes my interactions with others. My ultimate goals are to meet people where they are, have fun, and keep improving.

I am a natural coach and mentor whether on the job or on the baseball field. I enjoy partnering with others and sharing experiences to build trust and empathy. It fills me to watch someone else grow and improve.

I am obsessed with staying current. Techniques, technology, or TV shows, I refuse to fall behind. Staying current helps me relate to my kids and help them navigate an ever-changing world. Having broader knowledge gives me more opportunity to volunteer my time and skills.

I look at problems holistically to drive outcomes for customers. I allow the feedback cycle to guide the work by observing, measuring, and adjusting to meet customer needs. We are nothing without our customers.

I shine when I am simplifying complex problems. I love getting to a solution that not only works for me, but also for others. I get joy from seeing someone extend upon my solutions to help even more people.

### Values that are extremely important to me

I worked almost 3 years at Pivotal Software and I carry these 3 values with me.

* Be Kind: I strongly believe that you can be kind and empathetic, while still being direct.
* Do what works: I believe in working iteratively. Make it work, then we can make it better.
* Do the right thing: In every situation I have a choice of how to act. Sometimes the right thing is also the hard thing. Don't avoid it.

### 360 Feedback

In the spirit of transparency, I'll share a summary of 360 feedback from March 2023 in my current role:

#### Strengths

Thad has strong knowledge and vision in his domain and is focused on modernizing and standardizing processes to maximize sales and income while enabling new business opportunities. He is a pragmatic and straightforward leader who challenges the status quo and looks for better solutions. He is also a thought leader and technical visionary who can influence the rest of the organization. He is good at running meetings and focuses on what matters most. He should continue to use his soft skills to influence others and elevate those who can deliver outcomes for the company. He also advocates for "self-service" software and wants to focus on how to enable the organization and their needs in the finance and transaction space. He has been noticed to be good at interjecting and delegating issues.

#### Opportunities

Thad is a strong team member who can understand and identify potential long-term resolutions for problems the team is facing. However, he can get flustered when situations are complicated and may simplify things too much, causing him to lose focus on important details. He should work on identifying when this happens and take a moment to reset. He has been helpful in driving decisions recently, but should continue to identify roadblocks and interject his opinions. He has potential as a strong engineering leader, but may need to work on his executive presence and patience. It's suggested to provide a shorter list of feedback for him to work on and add more based on progress.

#### Elevator Pitch

Thad is an experienced and skilled engineering leader who is dedicated to finding solutions to problems and working towards long-term goals. He is action-oriented, approachable, and able to speak up when necessary. He has a strong track record of elevating teams he works with and is passionate about using technology to innovate and improve his space. He is also described as outgoing, courageous, and genuine, with a strong technical mind and a focus on doing the right thing. Overall, Thad is seen as a valuable and reliable partner for any team.

## My working style

### What I assume about you

* Positive intent.
* You’ll ask for my input and help if it’s needed. Otherwise, I will stay out of your way.
* Work is absolutely not the most important thing in your life.

### Communicating with me

* I try to express gratitude frequently. This is genuine.
* I like to fix things. Please let me know if you just need to vent with no action.
* Sometimes, my calendar will be packed with meetings. Please DM me on Slack if you can’t find time, I will always make time for you.
