# Thad Craft - Husband, Father, Software Engineer, Tech Leader

Hi, I’m Thad. I lead our internal developer platform as a Director and Product Leader at [Kohl's](https://kohls.com/). This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before.

It’s also a well-intentioned effort to build some trust by being intentionally vulnerable and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team. Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a pull request.

## About Me

I was born and raised in northern Indiana. I spent nearly ten years in Illinois for a job, but I moved back to Indiana in 2019, thanks to remote work. My wife and I met in high school, attended Purdue University(Boiler Up!), and I skipped college graduation to marry her. We homeschool our three kids, raise a few pigs yearly, and try to teach our kids through travel.

* I love sports, sometimes to the detriment of those around me.
* I am passionate about traveling and finding local cuisine.
* I try my best to be actively helpful and kind.
  * I'm working on saying "no" for my mental wellbeing.
* I want to get into the details and learn the "how" of everything.
  * I am actively focusing on whether the work gets done rather than how it gets done.
* I am very social and enjoy talking with people.
  * However, I am working to improve my focus to avoid distractions. Call me out if I get distracted.
* I have struggled with imposter syndrome as my career has progressed.
  * To help with this, I am attempting to reframe my definition of success. As an engineer, it was easy to see success in software that works; as a leader, success comes from the outcomes of others.

### My Brand

First and foremost, I am a husband and a father of three kids. On any given day, I am a referee, chauffeur, hair stylist, and/or frozen pizza chef. Taking care of my family drives me. Combining my personal and professional experience leads to my growth and shapes my interactions with others. My ultimate goals are meeting people where they are, having fun, and improving.

I am a natural coach and mentor, whether on the job or on the baseball field. I enjoy partnering with others and sharing experiences to build trust and empathy. It fills me with joy to watch someone else grow and improve.

I am obsessed with staying current. Whether it's techniques, technology, or TV shows, I stay caught up. Staying current helps me relate to my kids and help them navigate an ever-changing world. Having broader knowledge gives me more opportunities to volunteer my time and skills.

I look at problems holistically to drive customer outcomes. I allow the feedback cycle to guide my work by observing, measuring, and adjusting to meet customer needs. We are nothing without our customers.

I shine when I simplify complex problems. I love finding a solution that works not only for me but also for others. I get joy from seeing someone extend my solutions to help even more people.

### Values that are extremely important to me

I worked for a couple of years at Pivotal Software and carry these three values.

* Be Kind: I firmly believe you can be kind and empathetic while being direct.
* Do what works: I believe in working iteratively. Make it work, and then we can make it better.
* Do the right thing: In every situation, there is a choice of how to act. Sometimes, the right thing is also the hard thing. Don't avoid it.

### 360 Feedback

In the spirit of transparency, I'll share a summary of 360 feedback from March 2023 in my current role:

#### Strengths

Thad has substantial knowledge and vision in his domain and is focused on modernizing and standardizing processes to maximize sales and income while enabling new business opportunities. He is a pragmatic and straightforward leader who challenges the status quo and looks for better solutions. He is also a thought leader and technical visionary who can influence the rest of the organization. He is good at running meetings and focuses on what matters most. He should continue to use his soft skills to influence others and elevate those who can deliver outcomes for the company. He also advocates for "self-service" software and wants to focus on enabling the organization and its financial and transaction needs. He has been noticed to be good at interjecting and delegating issues.

#### Opportunities

Thad is a vital team member who can understand and identify potential long-term resolutions for problems the team is facing. However, he can get flustered when situations are complicated and may simplify things too much, causing him to lose focus on essential details. He should work on identifying when this happens and take a moment to reset. He has helped drive decisions recently but should continue identifying roadblocks and interjecting his opinions. He has the potential to be a strong engineering leader but may need to work on his executive presence and patience. It's suggested that he provide a shorter list of feedback to work on and add more based on progress.

#### Elevator Pitch

Thad is an experienced and skilled engineering leader dedicated to finding solutions to problems and working towards long-term goals. He is action-oriented, approachable, and able to speak up when necessary. He has a strong track record of elevating teams he works with and is passionate about using technology to innovate and improve his space. He is also described as outgoing, courageous, and genuine, with a strong technical mind and focused on doing the right thing. Overall, Thad is seen as a valuable and reliable partner for any team.
